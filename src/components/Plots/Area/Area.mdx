# Area Component

The `<Area>` component allows us to define an area plot on our chart.

### Props

Also includes all props from [XY Plot Components API](XYPlot.md)

| Prop           | Type          | Default            | Note                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `color`        | `string`      | Derived from Theme | The colour of the data.                                                                                      |
| `layer`\*      | `HTMLElement` |                    | This is an _internal_ field and should not need setting manually. It is populated `withSVG` or `withCanvas`. |
| `x`\*          | `string`      | null               | The key of the field that contains the value along the x-axis.                                               |
| `y`\*          | `string`      | null               | The key of the field that contains the value along the y-axis.                                               |
| `onMouseOver`  | `Function`    | `() => {}`         | Event handler to call when the mouse enter a DataPoint.                                                      |
| `onMouseOut`   | `Function`    | `() => {}`         | Event handler to call when the mouse exits a DataPoint.                                                      |
| `onMouseClick` | `Function`    | `() => {}`         | Event handler to call when the mouse clicks a DataPoint.                                                     |

### Stream Graph

export const StreamAreaTemplate = (args) => (
    <Chart {...args} data={sales_records_dataset}>
        <YAxis fields={[args.y, args.y2]} />
        <XAxis fields={[args.x]} showGridlines={false} />
        <Area
            x={args.x}
            y={args.y}
            y2={args.y2}
            radius={args.radius}
            color={args.color}
            animationDuration={args.animationDuration}
        />
    </Chart>
);

The `<Area>` component also allows us to represent a Stream plot.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-area--stream" />
</Canvas>

## Visual Styling

Most of the configuration for a `<Area>` is similar to other plots. Currently the only styling property avaliable is the colour option.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-area--color" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple Series

There are two ways to combine multiple area plots, either:

-   Overlapping Areas
-   Stacked Areas

### Overlapping Areas

There are two ways to go about defining multiple area plots for overlapping. The simplest way is to use the `<Areas>` (plural) component. The `<Areas>` component allows us to define multiple series at once and takes care of automaticallying layering and assigning colors.

The long hand way is to define each `<Area>`, and configure with a colour manually. The only advantage to this approach is if you wish to control other settings (such as events) differently between the plots.

The results of either approach, render in exactly the same way:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-area--multiple-areas" />
</Canvas>

### Stacked Charts

Another way to to combine area plots is to stack them on top of each other. To stack area plots you **must** use the `<Areas>` (plural) component and ensure that you set stacked field `<Areas ... stacked={true} />`.

The chart will attempt to warn you, but you should also set the `aggregate` field on your X Axis/Scale as otherwise the data will overflow of the top of the scale `<XAxis ... aggregate={true} />`.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-area--stacked-areas" />
</Canvas>
