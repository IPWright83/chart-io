# Welcome to chart-it

Chart-it provides a set of reusable chart components to make data visualization easy. It aims to provide high-level components that require minial configuration to provide great looking charts, while also providing access to the low level components giving you the flexibility to customize them as you see fit.

Here are some of the key features of chart-it at a glance:

- Minimal configuration
- Built with extensibility in mind
- Switch between `SVG` or `HTML5 Canvas` rendering
- Supports progressive rendering for large datasets
- Open source

## The Journey

Chart-it is early on in it's journey, and has a couple of aims:

- To allow producing charts with minimal to zero config
- To support different libraries/frameworks
- To finance continuous development & improvement of itself

For the immediate future development is progressing to purely provide support for React until the library has enough visualizations and has established itself.
