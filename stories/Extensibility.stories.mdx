# Extending Charts

One of the key features of all the visualizations provided is the ability to extend them. There are a number of design decisions made, so that you as the developer can tweak and customize your charts easily.

## Extending the Redux Store

Each individual chart has it's own unique [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store. This store is used to contain all the transient state for the visualization but is also the best way to hook into the interaction mechanisms.

The store is designed such that you can listen to state changes if you wish, but you can also inject your own reducers into the store.

### Listening to state changes

If you wish to listen to state changes within a visualization, or simply obtain the state for some reason then you'll first need access to the store. To do this you need to register for the `onStoreCreated` callback. This will be triggered once during the initialisation of the chart.

```
const onStoreCreated = (store) => {
   // The store can now be acccessed. If you need dynamic access store
   // this value using a React useState hook.
};

<Chart onStoreCreated={onStoreCreated} ...>
  ...
</Chart>
```

From this point on you have access to all the usual functions on a Redux store, such as `dispatch` and `getState`.

### Registering a custom Reducer

It is also possible to create a custom reducer that you can then hook into your own components rendered on the chart. To do this you need to provide a `customReducers` prop into your chart. You should only initialise this once, and not change the reducers, otherwise the store will be re-generated and may lose it's current state.

The customReducers prop takes the form of a keyed object, where each key represents part of the store.

> **Note:** The following reducer names are reserved: `chart`, `event`, `telemetry`

```
// You typically want to define these outside of a React component, as if the
// component were to re-render, the customReducers would take a new reference
// value and cause the store to be re-initialised
const customReducers = {
  tooltips: (state = {}, action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
      case "EVENT.MOUSE_ENTER": {
        return { tooltip: true, ...state };
      }
      default: return state;
    }
  }
}
```
