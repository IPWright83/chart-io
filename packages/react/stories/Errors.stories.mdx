With both Errors and Warnings that appear on the console, further information can be found by finding the appropriate page containing the error/warning prefix.

# Errors

Ocasionally when using chart-it you might encounter an error. If this has been logged to the console with a prefix such as `E001` then this means it's something chart-it due to bad configuration and it will attempt to prompt you on how to fix it.

# Warnings

You may also encounter warnings when using chart-it. Again if prefixed these usually indicate a configuration error, often in these cases you will have a partially rendered chart.
