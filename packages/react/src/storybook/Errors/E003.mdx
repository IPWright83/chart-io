# E003 Stacked & Grouped not supported

> `Bar plots do not support both being stacked and grouped`  
> `Column plots do not support both being stacked and grouped`

## Cause

When multiple plots are created for a bar on column chart they can be either stacked or grouped. @chart-it does not support both of these options being set at the same time.

## Fix

Decide whether you want to apply:

-   Stacking (bars/columns) sit on top of each other
-   Grouping (bars/columns) sit side by side

Then set either the `grouped` or `stacked` option to `true`, but not both options at the same time.
