# E006 Scale requires at least one field

> `Unable to create a Scale without a field. Ensure that you have provided at least one field in the 'fields' prop`

## Cause

To render a `<Scale>` a field that keys into the data is required. This is needed to allow a scale to be calculated so the data range can be converted to screen co-ordinates. It appears that no field was provided.

## Fix

Supply one or more fields as either a string or string array, that refer to values in your data objects. For example in the following data `x` or `y` could be used:

```
[
    { x: 1, y: 1 },
    { x: 2, y: 2 },
    { x: 3, y: 3 },
    { x: 4, y: 4 },
    { x: 5, y: 5 },
]
```
