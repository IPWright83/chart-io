# E004 Multiple Plots must be Stacked or Grouped

> `Multiple Bar plots must be either stacked or grouped`  
> `Multiple Column plots must be either stacked or grouped`

## Cause

When multiple plots are created for a bar on column chart they must be either stacked or grouped otherwise they would
render on top of each other.

## Fix

Decide whether you want to apply:

-   Stacking (bars/columns) sit on top of each other
-   Grouping (bars/columns) sit side by side

Then set either the `grouped` or `stacked` option to `true`.
