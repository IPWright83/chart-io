# E007 Unkown Scale Type

> `Unknown scale type: ${scaleType}`

## Cause

Only a subset of d3 scale types are currently supported, and the one provided is not in the list of supported scale types

## Fix

Change the scaleType you have provided to your `<AutoScale>` or `<XAxis>|<YAxis>` component to one of:

    - band
    - point
    - power
    - linear
    - time
    - log

Alternatively you can define your own scale, and use `<Axis>` instead.
