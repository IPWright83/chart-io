# E008 Redux Link Stores called multiple times

> `The linkStores() function can strictly only be called once during initialisation`

## Cause

The `linkStores` function used to link chart events together must only be called once during the initialisation of your page. In this instance it was called multiple times

## Fix

Ensure you only call the `linkStores()` function once, if necessary delaying this call until all the stores are available.
