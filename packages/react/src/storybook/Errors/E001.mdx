# E001 Incompatible Scale

> `Incompatible scale for a <${componentName} />. Are you missing the 'scaleType="band"' in your <Axis /> or <AutoScale /> component?`

## Cause

The cause of this is because a non discrete scale has typically been used with a discrete plot (e.g. a time scale with a column chart).

## Fix

Inform the scale that it should be discrete by adding the 'scaleType="band"' property to the appropriate Scale or Axis component.
