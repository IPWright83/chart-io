# W005 Invalid Margin

For charts to operate properly they need a valid margin. This warning protects against a margin that is missing one of the sides.

> `The left of the margin was not specified and is required`  
> `The right of the margin was not specified and is required`  
> `The top of the margin was not specified and is required`  
> `The bottom of the margin was not specified and is required`

We use the D3 margin convention - https://observablehq.com/@d3/margin-convention

## Cause

The margin is missing one of the sides that are required, as specified in the error message. A margin requires a non null value for all sides and should take the shape:

```
{
    left: number;
    top: number;
    right: number;
    bottom: number;
}
```

## Fix

Provide a value for the missing side of the margin, using `0` if no margin is required.
