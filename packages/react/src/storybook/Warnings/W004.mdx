# W004 Missing Margin

> `A margin was not provided but is required`

For charts to operate properly they need a margin. This warning protects against a missing margin.

## Cause

The margin provided to the `setDimensions` redux action was `null` or `undefined`. This usually indicates that you specified an empty margin when creating an instance of the chart.

## Fix

Ensure that you either leave the `plotMargin` prop blank, or provide a correctly shaped margin object.
