# W003 Missing Class Name

Class names in @chart-it are generally used to help identify elements within the DOM, but can also be used for CSS styling if neccessary. As we assume they are set, the lack of a value causes `g-undefined` to appear in the DOM. This warning is trying to prevent this from happening.

## Cause

This warning indicates that you are attempting to use the `withSVG` or `withCanvas` higher order component, and that the expected class name was not provided.

## Fix

Pass a class name as the 2nd parameter to the `withSVG` or `withCanvas` higher order function.
