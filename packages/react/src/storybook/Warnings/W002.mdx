# W002 Duplicate Values

This warning indicates that there were unexpected duplicate values along an axis (within the same series). For some charts this is perfectly acceptable (such as a Scatter where more than 1 point can share the same x value). However for many charts such as Line or Column charts, this could lead to a rendering artifiact where you attempt to render 2 items at that same point.

> `W002 - There are duplicate values in the ${field} field. This may cause rendering artifacts with a <${componentName}>.`

## Cause

Within the field mentioned there were duplicate values (e.g. multiple x values of 5 - `{ x: 5, y: 2 }, { x: 5, y: 3 }`) which the plot selected can not support.

## Fix

Choose a different plot type, or filter out the duplicate records from the dataset.
