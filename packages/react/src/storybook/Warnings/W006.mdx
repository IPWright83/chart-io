# W006 Canvas Unsupported Node Type

> `Unsupported node type: ${node.nodeName}`

## Cause

When using a Canvas instead of SVG only certain node types can be converted to canvas. In this case a node was encountered that @chart-io does not know how to automatically convert to the canvas equivalent

## Fix

Avoid using unsupported node types when trying to use the automatic canvas conversion. Currently supported node types are:

-   `svg:circle`
-   `svg:rect`
