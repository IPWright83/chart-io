# W007 Incompatible Scale

> `An incompatible scale was used with a <HorizontalBrush>`

This warning indicates that a brush was being used, but the scale associated with it does not support the `.invert()` function, which is required to translate from screen coordinates back to data coordinates.

## Cause

The cause of this is usually that you're trying to include a brush for zooming, with a type of plot that doesn't support it.

## Fix

Remove the `<Brush>` component or swap out the plots that you are using to ones which support brushes.
