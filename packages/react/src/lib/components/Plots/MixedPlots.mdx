# Mixed Plots

It is possible to mix plot types, although depending on the scales @chart-io has to do a little bit of manipulation to try and obtain a sufficient layout due to limitations in D3. To begin with it's worth understanding the difference between continuous and discrete plots.

Continuous plots are those which have a linear scales without any gaps, examples are typically:

-   Line
-   Area
-   Scatter

Discrete plots have a finite number of values and are typically:

-   Column
-   Bar

## Mixing Continuous Plots

When attempting to mix continuous plots, typically a linear type scale has been selected (`d3.scaleLinear` for example) and data will line up nicely and just work.

## Mixing Continuous Plots with a Band scale

Using a Band scale is preferred for Column & Bar plots (set by applying `scaleType="band"` in your `<Axis>` or `<AutoScale>`) adding a continuous plot will attempt to offset the data to ensure it lines up with the columns or bars.

> You can see this affect, by noting how the line does not meet the y-axis in this example.

## Mixing a Discrete Plot with a Continuous Scale

You may prefer to use a continuous scale however. In the example above we can see how the axis labels are not formatted nicely. A `d3.scaleTime` does a much better job of formatting the labels automatically as per the first example, however this can cause bars to be cut off.

When using a discrete plot such as a Column plot witha a linear scale, @chart-io will attempt to manually calculate the width of bars as it's unable to rely on the D3 scale functionality. This relies on the first 2 data points having valid values. If it is unable to do so it will display an error in the console.

> The reason for the manual calculation is Bar & Column plots typically need to use a [scaleBand](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#band-scales). These scales aren't as powerful for plotting continuous data such as time, but they do provide the nice functions for padding/width of bars. So instead these are manually derived from the data.

The preferred approach for mixing Columns & other plots is to stick with a `band` scale and apply some custom formatting.

## Custom formatting

Therefore it's recommended to use D3 helper functions to manually define your `tickValues` that you want to present, and potentially the `tickFormat` as well. The next examples do this by providing the following two props:

```
const tickFormat = useCallback((tickValue, index) => {
    return index % 3 !== 0 ?       // Only show every 3rd tick
        null :
        d3.utcFormat("%b")(value); // Use the D3 short month format
}, []);

const tickValues = useMemo(() => d3.utcMonths(...d3.extent(data.map(d => d[x]))), [data, x]);

...
<XAxis fields={args.x} scaleType="band" tickFormat={tickFormat} tickValues={tickValues} />
```
