# Mixed Plots

It is possible to mix plot types, although a @chart-it has to do a little bit of manipulation to try and obtain a sufficient layout due to limitations in D3. Mixing continuous plot types such as Line, Area and Scatter just works.

When adding a Column plot @chart-it will attempt to manually calculate the width of bars rather than relying on the D3 scale functionality. This relies on the first 2 data points having valid values. If it is unable to do so it will display an error in the console.

> The reason for the manual calculation is Bar/Column plots typically need to use a [scaleBand](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#band-scales). These scales aren't as powerful for plotting continuous data such as time, but do provide nice functions for padding/width of bars. So instead these are manually derived from the data.
