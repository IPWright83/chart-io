# RectangleClipPath Component

The `<RectangleClipPath>` component allows us to create a clip path to ensure that any artifacts that appear outside the visible range are not rendered. This is especially useful when zooming into the domain on a chart so is frequently used with Brushes.

    In the example below a black rectangle has been added to show the dimensions of the `<RectangleClipPath>` component. You can see how the circle has been chopped in half and anything outside of the clip path does not render.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-rectangleclippath--default" />
</Canvas>

## Adding a RectangleClipPath

To use a `<RectangleClipPath>` component you should wrap it around all your children that require clipping. For example you may wrap several plots like so:

```
<RectangleClipPath>
    <Line x="x" y="y" />
    <Line x="x" y="y2" />
</RectangleClipPath>
```

This will dynamically inject a `clipPath` prop into the components which can be consumed using the form:

```
const MyClippedComponent = ({ clipPath }: { clipPath?: string }) => {
    return <circle clipPath={`url(#${clipPath})`} ... />;
};
```
