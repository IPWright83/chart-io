# EventReceiver Component

The `<EventReceiver>` component is an internal component used for capturing mouse events on SVG based charts.

Some plots do not provide a suitable element to capture events on (such as a Line chart) so instead they are captured on this component and events are dispatched to the internal redux store - giving plots a chance to respond to these changes.
