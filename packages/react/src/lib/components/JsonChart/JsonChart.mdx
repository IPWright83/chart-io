# JsonChart Component

The `<JsonChart>` component allows us to define an XYChart with a configuration that is more easily serialized to a database by splitting out all the props into a large JSON object. Using this approach we can build most charts like so:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="components-jsonchart--line" />
</Canvas>
<br />

## Creating a JsonChart

To create a JsonChart you simply need to provide it with 2 simple props `config` and `data`. The `config` prop however contains multiple settings within, depending on the type of chart you want:

| Prop     | Type     | Note                                 |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `data`   | `IData`  | The data for the chart               |
| `config` | `object` | The full configuration for the chart |

Breaking down the `config` object further:

| Prop              | Type            | Note                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chart`           | `IXYChartProps` | All the chart propers (except data)                                                    |
| `series`          | `ISeriesConfig` | The config for the series (split by `lines`, `areas`, `scatters`, `columns` & `bars` ) |
| `series.lines`    | `object`        | The config for the line plots                                                          |
| `series.scatters` | `object`        | The config for the scatter plots                                                       |
| `axis`            | `object`        | The axis config                                                                        |
| `axis.x`          | `IXAxisProps`   | The config for the x-axis                                                              |
| `axis.y`          | `IXAxisProps`   | The config for the x-axis                                                              |

An example of the config for the above chart is:

```
const config = useMemo({
    {
        chart: {
            width: 800,
        },
        axis: {
            x: {
                fields: "Order Date",
            },
        },
        series: {
            lines: {
                ys: ["Total Cost", "Total Profit"],
            },
        },
    },
});
```

You should remember to memoize objects when dealing with large config objects to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Limitations:

It's worth noting that a few fields that you can specify within the configuration, you will not be able to serialize to a database. Examples of these are the event handlers (`onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut`, `onClick`) and also some of the more advanced properties such as the Axis `tickFormat` prop which requires a function.
