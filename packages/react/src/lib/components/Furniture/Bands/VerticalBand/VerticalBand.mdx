# VerticalBand Component

The `<VerticalBand>` component allows us to define a layer to render a custom vertical rectangle either underneath or on top of the plots. This can be useful for defining threshold bands in the background, along with a variety of other use cases.

You could do this manully using an `<svg:rect>` however the `<VerticalBand>` reduces the amount of code required by giving you access to the scale. Simply passing the value (according to the scale rather than pixel co-ordinates) the band will render across the full height between the given calculated x-coordinates.

This can be especially useful when combined with plots for creating threshold bands. Here the bands are defined as:

-   xStart: `undefined`, xStop: `2000`
-   xStart: `2000`, xStop: `7000`
-   xStart: `7000`, xStop: `undefined`

> Note: When passing `undefined` the band will move to the start of the scale (for `xStart`) or the end of the scale (for `xStop`) appropriately.
