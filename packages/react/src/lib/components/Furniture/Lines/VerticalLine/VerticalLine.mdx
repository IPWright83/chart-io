# VerticalLine Component

The `<VerticalLine>` component allows us to define a layer to render a custom vertical line either underneath or on top of the plots. This can be useful for defining a constant line such as the current date or a key threshold.

You could do this manully using an `<svg:line>` however the `<VerticalLine>` reduces the amount of code required by giving you access to the scale. Simply passing the value (according to the scale rather than pixel co-ordinates) the band will render across the full height at the given calculated x-coordinate.
