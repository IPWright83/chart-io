# Getting Started

To get started with `@chart-io` first ensure that you've installed the package using one of the following commands:

```
npm install @chart-io/react  //npm
yarn add @chart-io/react     // yarn
pnpm add @chart-io/react     // pnpm
```

## Deciding on your chart type

Then you can start building your first chart. There are two ways to go about doing this, you can either use:

-   `<XYChart>` - simpler setup for charts with 2 Axis
-   `<Chart>` - allows other chart types, or provides more granular control for charts with 2 Axis

Typically the process of building a chart then involves:

-   Deciding on the fields you wish to plot
-   Define some Scales or Axis for these components
-   Creating a "Plot" for each series

## Basic Example using `<XYChart>` component

Here is a basic example of a column chart using the `<XYChart>` component:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-column--basic" />
</Canvas>

In the code below we can see that we do a few things:

-   Provide the data to the chart as an array of objects
-   Set some margins (this provides space for the axis labels)
-   Set the x/y fields

```
const data = [{ itemType: "Baby Food", price: 255 }, { itemType: "Cereal", price: 205 }, ...]
const plotMargin = { left: 70, top: 40, right: 40, bottom: 40 };

<XYChart data={data} plotMargin={plotMargin} width={800} height={500}>
    <YAxis fields="price" />
    <XAxis fields="itemType" scaleType="band" />
    <Column x="itemType" y="price" />
</XYChart>
```

## Using the `<Chart>` component

You can also build a visualization using the `<Chart>` component, including the column chart above. However it's a little more complex. The `<XYChart>` component takes care of adding a number of the core components that you typically want.

To build the example above you would use the following code. You can read about the different components and what they do in the **Components** section of this Storybook.

```
const data = [{ itemType: "Baby Food", price: 255 }, { itemType: "Cereal", price: 205 }, ...]

<Chart {...props}>
    <EventReceiver />
    <YAxis fields="price" />
    <XAxis fields="itemType" scaleType="band" />
    <Column x="itemType" y="price" />
    <Markers />
    <Droplines />
    <TooltipOverlay />
</Chart>
```
