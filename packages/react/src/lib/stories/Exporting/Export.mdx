# Exporting Charts

chart-io provides the ability to export a chart to an image file so you can download and save charts for later. While embedding charts usually provides a better experience this is a great fallback alternative.

## Accessing the chart-ref

Firstly to trigger the export function, you are going to need to get a reference to the chart instance itself. This can simply be done by using the following:

```
const chartRef = useRef(null);

// Assuming you have a button to trigger the export
const onExportClick = useCallback(() => {
    if (chartRef.current) {
        chartRef.current.exportImage(...);
    }
});

return (<XYChart ref={chartRef} .../>)
```

## `exportImage` parameters

These are the parameters that you can pass to `exportImage`. Note that `filename` is required.

| Category         | Type   | Default     | Note                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`filename`\*** | string | `undefined` | The filename to save the chart to. Note that you do not need to provide the extension               |
| `format`         | string | `"PNG"`     | The format to save the chart to, either "JPG" or "PNG"                                              |
| `scale`          | number | `1`         | The scale to save the chart to. Increasing this increases the dimensions and file size of the image |
