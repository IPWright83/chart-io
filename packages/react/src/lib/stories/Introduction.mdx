# Welcome to @chart-it

Chart-it provides a set of reusable chart components to make data visualization easy. It aims to provide high-level components that require minial configuration to provide great looking charts, while also providing an escape hatch to access the low level components giving you the flexibility to customize them as you see fit. All of this is built using D3.js to reduce the learning curve in tweaking the behaviours.

Here are some of the key features of @chart-it at a glance:

-   Minimal configuration
-   Built with extensibility in mind. Easy escape hatches to allow customization with D3.js
-   Switch between `SVG` or `Canvas` rendering
-   Supports progressive rendering for large datasets

## The Journey

Chart-it is early on in it's journey, and has a few aims:

-   To allow producing charts with minimal to zero config
-   To support different libraries/frameworks
-   To finance continuous development & improvement of itself

For the immediate future development is progressing to purely provide support for React until the library has enough visualizations and has established itself.
