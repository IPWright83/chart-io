# Welcome to @chart-io

chart-io provides a set of reusable chart components to make data visualization easy. It aims to provide high-level components that require minial configuration to provide great looking charts, while also providing an escape hatch to access the low level components giving you the flexibility to customize them as you see fit. All of this is built using D3.js to reduce the learning curve in extending & tweaking.

Here are some of the key features of @chart-io at a glance:

-   Minimal configuration with sensible defaults
-   Built with extensibility in mind. Easy escape hatches to allow customization with D3.js
-   Switch between `SVG` or `Canvas` rendering
-   Supports progressive rendering for large datasets
