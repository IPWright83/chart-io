# Dashboards

One of the benefits of `@chart-it`'s extensibility is that it is simple to customize behaviour, including linking multiple charts together.

The example below shows a number of different charts, that all have linked tooltips and markers. To link these together we "link" the redux stores together using a helper function provided.

> **Note**: It is only possible to call this function once, so ensure all your charts have been initialised before linking them.

To link 2 stores together.

```
 useEffect(() => {
        if (store1 && store2) {
            linkStores([store1,store2]);
        }
    }, [store1, store2,
```

By default linking a store only links moust events, however the `linkStores` function takes a second parameter, which is a Regex that can be used to match other events. For example to include all tooltip values across charts you could use:

`linkStores([store1, store2], /EVENT.(MOUSE|ADD_TOOLTIP_ITEM|REMOVE_TOOLTIP_ITEM)/);`
