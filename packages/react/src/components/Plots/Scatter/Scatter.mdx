# Scatter Component

The `<Scatter>` component allows us to define a scatter plot on our chart.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-scatter--basic" />
</Canvas>

### Props

Also includes all props from [XY Plot Components API](XYPlot.md)

| Prop           | Type          | Default            | Note                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `color`        | `string`      | Derived from Theme | The colour of the data.                                                                                      |
| `layer`\*      | `HTMLElement` |                    | This is an _internal_ field and should not need setting manually. It is populated `withSVG` or `withCanvas`. |
| `radius`       | `number`      | 5                  | The radius to use for each data point on the Scatter chart.                                                  |
| `x`\*          | `string`      | null               | The key of the field that contains the value along the x-axis.                                               |
| `y`\*          | `string`      | null               | The key of the field that contains the value along the y-axis.                                               |
| `onMouseOver`  | `Function`    | `() => {}`         | Event handler to call when the mouse enter a DataPoint.                                                      |
| `onMouseOut`   | `Function`    | `() => {}`         | Event handler to call when the mouse exits a DataPoint.                                                      |
| `onMouseClick` | `Function`    | `() => {}`         | Event handler to call when the mouse clicks a DataPoint.                                                     |

## Visual Styling

Most of the configuration for a `<Scatter>` is similar to other plots. The main styling properties are that of a `radius` property allowing us to adjust the size of the points and a colour option.

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-scatter--radius" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple Series

There are two ways to go about defining multiple scatter plots. The simplest way is to use the `<Scatters>` (plural) component. The `<Scatters>` component allows us to define multiple series at once and takes care of automaticallying layering and assigning colors.

The long hand way is to define each `<Scatter>`, and configure with a colour manually. The only advantage to this approach is if you wish to control other settings (such as radius or events) differently between the plots.

The results of either approach, render in exactly the same way:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="xycharts-scatter--multiple-scatter" />
</Canvas>

#### Scale

It is however important to remember whichever approach you use to insert any additional keys that you are using into your `<YAxis>` or `<YScale>` component.

`<YAxis fields={["Total Profit", "Total Revenue", "Total Cost"]} />`
