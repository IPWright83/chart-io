# HorizontalBand Component

The `<HorizontalBand>` component allows us to define a layer to render a custom horizontal rectangle either underneath or on top of the plots. This can be useful for defining threshold bands in the background, along with a variety of other use cases.

You could do this manully using an `<svg:rect>` however the `<HorizontalBand>` reduces the amount of code required by giving you access to the scale. Simply passing the value (according to the scale rather than pixel co-ordinates) the band will render across the full width between the given calculated y-coordinates.

This can be especially useful when combined with plots for creating threshold bands. Here the bands are defined as:

-   yStart: `undefined`, yStop: `350000`
-   yStart: `350000`, yStop: `900000`
-   yStart: `900000`, yStop: `undefined`

> Note: When passing `undefined` the band will move to the start of the scale (for `yStart`) or the end of the scale (for `yStop`) appropriately.
